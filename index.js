/*how to populate 2 fields with a single function
    1. I need to generate a single random password which follows some rules
    2. after I generate one password I need to store it or update the field
    3. then I need to generate another password using the same rules
    and store it or update it somewhere
    4. I know I need the same code to generate a password, so let's start there
    Done! 
    5. Now I could either stick it in a variable (firstPwd) or the <p> directly
    6. I imagine that having a variable will help with copy-on-click
    7. Nevermind directly populating the <p> meets the need
    8. The real question is whether I can copy text from any text element? (<p> <button> etc?) 
    9. seems like you can.
    10.So, how do I create a second password?
    11. Just do it in the same for loop
