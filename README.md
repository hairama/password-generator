# Password Generator - Solo Project

## *Overview* 🧐
This project is part of the **"Making websites interactive"** module from the [**Frontend Career Path**](https://v2.scrimba.com/the-frontend-developer-career-path-c0j) course on [**Scrimba**](https://v2.scrimba.com/home).

Oldagram simulates a social media platform where users can view posts with photos, comments, and likes. Semantic HTML, interactive CSS effects, and JavaScript were used to dynamically render the posts.

## *What I learned* 🤓

🔳 **Importing constants from JS files:** I used `import` to manage icons and data from separate files, keeping the code modular and maintainable.

🔳 **Defer in JavaScript:** I used the `defer` attribute to ensure the script runs after the DOM is fully loaded.

🔳 **Focus-visible:** I implemented accessible styles to improve the visibility of focused elements, but only for keyboard users.

🔳 **Outline and accessibility:** I applied the outline attribute to maintain accessibility without compromising aesthetics, improving the experience for keyboard-dependent users.

🔳 **CSS transitions:** I added smooth transitions for hover and focus effects on the icons for a better user experience.
